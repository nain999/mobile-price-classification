# mobile-price-classification
The aim of mobile price classification is to predict price range of mobile phones based on numerous functionalities like battery power, bluetooth, clock speed, front camera, touch screen, wi-fi, internal memory, mobile height, mobile width, mobile depth, mobile weight, number of cores, primary camera resolution, pixel resolution height, pixel resolution width, RAM, screen height, screen width, and talk time. The intent of this study lies in mobile phone classification into predefined categories (0-low cost, 1-medium cost, 2- high cost, 3-very
high cost) based on mobile features using machine learning algorithms.
The observations will help in determining the most effective and accurate method to help customers and business to determine mobile price range based on mobile features. This methodology as shown in figure below incorporates strategic understanding, data collection and data insights, determining and depicting outliers, and model design which involves subsequent steps of data split
of different models (support vector machines, logistic regression, and decision trees), model analysis, model refinement, model review, and model performance.
